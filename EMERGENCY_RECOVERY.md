# üö® EMERGENCY: Recover Deleted Offers

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Do These NOW)

### Option 1: Check if You're in a Transaction (Unlikely but try)

If you ran the DELETE in a transaction and haven't closed the SQL editor:

```sql
-- Try this immediately:
ROLLBACK;
```

If you see "no transaction in progress" - move to Option 2.

---

### Option 2: Point-in-Time Recovery (Supabase Pro Only)

If you have a **Supabase Pro plan**, you can restore to before the delete:

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click **Database** ‚Üí **Backups**
4. Look for **Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)**
5. Select a timestamp from BEFORE you deleted
6. Click **Restore**

‚ö†Ô∏è **This will restore your ENTIRE database to that point**

---

### Option 3: Restore from Daily Backup (Pro Plan)

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Database ‚Üí Backups
3. Find the most recent backup from before deletion
4. Click **Restore**

Note: Daily backups are taken at a specific time, so you might lose recent data.

---

### Option 4: Check Supabase Logs (May show deleted data)

The logs might show the DELETE query and the deleted rows:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Click **Logs** ‚Üí **Database**
3. Look for your DELETE statement
4. The log MIGHT show what was deleted (not guaranteed)

---

### Option 5: Free Tier - Check if Auto-Backups Exist

Even on free tier, try:

1. Dashboard ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Backups
2. See if any backups are available
3. If yes, restore from the most recent one

---

## If You're on Free Tier with No Backups

Unfortunately, if you:
- ‚ùå Are on Supabase free tier
- ‚ùå Have no manual backups
- ‚ùå Deleted data with a simple DELETE statement
- ‚ùå Already committed the transaction

**The data is likely unrecoverable** üòû

### What You Can Do:

1. **Check your deployed site** - The frontend might still have cached data
2. **Check browser cache** - Some submissions might be visible in browser dev tools
3. **Ask users to resubmit** - Apologize and request resubmissions
4. **Learn and prevent** - Set up better safeguards (see below)

---

## Prevent This From Happening Again

### 1. Always Use WHERE Clause Carefully

```sql
-- DANGEROUS (deletes everything):
DELETE FROM public.offers;

-- SAFER (test with SELECT first):
SELECT * FROM public.offers WHERE created_at < '2025-01-01';
-- Then if it looks right:
DELETE FROM public.offers WHERE created_at < '2025-01-01';
```

### 2. Always Test with SELECT First

```sql
-- Step 1: SELECT to see what will be affected
SELECT * FROM public.offers WHERE company_name = 'Shopify';

-- Step 2: Count to verify
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.offers WHERE company_name = 'Shopify';

-- Step 3: Only then DELETE
DELETE FROM public.offers WHERE company_name = 'Shopify';
```

### 3. Use Transactions for Safety

```sql
-- Start transaction
BEGIN;

-- Do your delete
DELETE FROM public.offers WHERE company_name = 'Shopify';

-- Check the result
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.offers;

-- If something looks wrong:
ROLLBACK;  -- Undo everything

-- If it looks right:
COMMIT;  -- Make it permanent
```

### 4. Create Manual Backups Before Risky Operations

```sql
-- Create backup table before deleting
CREATE TABLE offers_backup_2025_10_30 AS 
SELECT * FROM public.offers;

-- Then do your delete
DELETE FROM public.offers WHERE condition;

-- If you need to restore:
INSERT INTO public.offers 
SELECT * FROM offers_backup_2025_10_30;
```

### 5. Upgrade to Supabase Pro

**Cost**: $25/month per project

**Benefits**:
- Point-in-Time Recovery (restore to any moment in last 7 days)
- Daily automated backups
- Better support
- More database space

## Try to Recover From Your Deployed Site

If your site is live, some data might still be cached:

### Check Browser Dev Tools:
1. Open your deployed site
2. Press F12 (Dev Tools)
3. Go to **Application** ‚Üí **Local Storage**
4. Look for cached data

### Check Network Tab:
1. F12 ‚Üí Network tab
2. Reload your browse page
3. Look for API calls to Supabase
4. Check the response - it might still show old cached data

### Export from Live Site:
If you can still see offers on your live site, quickly export them:

```javascript
// Run in browser console on your site
const offers = await (await fetch('YOUR_SUPABASE_URL/rest/v1/offers', {
  headers: {
    'apikey': 'YOUR_ANON_KEY',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY'
  }
})).json();

console.log(JSON.stringify(offers, null, 2));
// Copy this output and save it!
```

## Last Resort: Contact Supabase Support

Even on free tier, try contacting them:

1. Go to https://supabase.com/support
2. Or Discord: https://discord.supabase.com
3. Explain what happened
4. Ask if they can help recover (unlikely on free tier, but worth trying)

---

## What Did You Actually Run?

Tell me exactly what SQL command you ran, and I can help determine if there's any chance of recovery.

Was it:
- `DELETE FROM public.offers;` (all offers)
- `DELETE FROM public.offers WHERE ...;` (specific offers)
- `TRUNCATE TABLE public.offers;` (all offers, faster)
- `DROP TABLE public.offers;` (deleted the entire table)

---

## Going Forward: Enable Better Protection

I can help you set up:
1. **Soft deletes** - Mark as deleted instead of actually deleting
2. **Audit logs** - Track all changes to offers table
3. **Regular backups** - Automated backup script
4. **Read-only views** - Prevent accidental deletes from dashboard

Let me know what happened and I'll help you try to recover!
